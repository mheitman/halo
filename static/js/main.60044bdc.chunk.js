I knew right away that Halo was a caring company, when I received a call on a Sunday. They were very pleasant, knowing that we only had 10 days to find a house, and close on a house!!. HALO was very encouraging, and positive about the whole situation. The whole process with Halo was very none stressful, the communication was very good. Halo maid it possible we closed, and we were in our new home within 9 days!! Halo has been very informative, and very pleasant. We highly recommend HALO!!",name:"Nora R., TX"},{image:$.a,text:"A remarkable company! HALO is providing me the opportunity to attain a goal I never dreamed I could on my own. Home ownership was not something I thought in the realm of possibility given my credit history and the fact that I am a single income household. Working with my realtor, my mortgage company, and HALO has provided that, and also a sense of accomplishment. They have cheered me on and repeatedly affirmed that my goal was possible. It was a seamless process. My stress level could have been unbearable but I was reassured over and over by all involved. These wonderful people take the time to help those who would likely otherwise never realize the dream of home ownership. What they do is a great thing.
